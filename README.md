I made this landing page using CSS and html. The html was quite straightforward, but there were some obstacles to the styling. Making the text wrap appropriately was difficult, as was adding in background features (gradient, shading).

Here are some screenshots of my progress along the way:

Pure HTML, no styling:

Added in icons for contact:

Without media queries to deal with resizing:

The final landing pages responds well to size changes, has good icons, and some interesting links to different web pages.
